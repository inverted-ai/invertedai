# Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to use the Inverted AI API in Python. 
<!-- start exampels -->
[Click here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/inverted-ai/invertedai/tree/master/examples) to download the folder as a zip-file.
To run the examples locally, first build the virtual environment.
```commandline
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
*If running into package not found issue like`ERROR: No matching distribution found for carla==0.9.13`, try update 
the pip: `pip install upgrade pip `.  

Then, once you obtain an API key, you can run the examples.
```commandline
python npc_only.py --api_key $IAI_API_KEY
```
There are currently three different examples available.

## NPC only

This demonstration script runs without a local simulator and the API is used to control
all vehicles, meaning all vehicles in the simulation are NPCs. To minimize client-side
complexity, the visualizations are provided through the API, which is very inefficient
and only used for demonstration purposes ([click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/inverted-ai/invertedai-drive/blob/develop/examples/response_time.ipynb) for response time comparison). The purpose of those demonstrations is to
quickly give you an idea for how the underlying NPCs behave. This example is available
in a few different versions, one calling the underlying REST API directly, and others
using the wrapper provided as a part of our library, the latter version also being
available as a Jupyter notebook and
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/inverted-ai/invertedai-drive/blob/develop/examples/npc_only_colab.ipynb).

## Cosimulation Minimal example

The minimal example, as shown on the front page, mocks up the local simulator with
a class that implements trivial control logic for the ego vehicle. This example is
meant to provide an illustration of the basic logic for performing co-simulation
using Inverted AI API and give you a sandbox to experiment with it. It will save 
the generated gif as `iai-example.gif` in the current directory.

## CARLA

Finally, as a realistic example, we provide a basic integration with CARLA.
This example is meant to provide a comprehensive illustration of co-simulation logic
and to be a starting point for creating custom scenarios with Inverted AI NPCs,
both in CARLA and in other simulators. Running CARLA requires additional setup,
which is documented within the corresponding subfolder.
