# Examples

We have a few examples that demonstrate the behavior of the API without running a local simulator.
To run the examples locally, first build the virtual environment.
```commandline
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, once you obtain an API key, you can run the examples.
```commandline
python Demo_Drive.py --api_key $IAI_API_KEY
```
