/**
 * Wrap the REST API "initialize".
 * Initializes a simulation in a given location, using a combination of **user-defined** and **sampled** agents.
 * **User-defined** agents are placed in a scene first, after which a number of agents are sampled conditionally 
 * inferred from the `num_agents_to_spawn` argument.
 * If **user-defined** agents are desired, `states_history` must contain a vector of `AgentState's` of all **user-defined** 
 * agents per historical time step.
 * Any **user-defined** agent must have a corresponding fully specified static `AgentAttribute` in `agent_attributes`. 
 * Any **sampled** agents not specified in `agent_attributes` will be generated with default static attribute values however
 * **sampled** agents may be defined by specifying `agent_type` only. 
 * Agents are identified by their vector index, so ensure the indices of each agent match in `states_history` and
 * `agent_attributes` when applicable. 
 * If traffic lights are present in the scene, for best results their state should be specified for the current time in a 
 * `TrafficLightStatesDict`, and all historical time steps for which `states_history` is provided. It is legal to omit
 * the traffic light state specification, but the scene will be initialized as if the traffic lights were disabled.
 * Every simulation must start with a call to this function in order to obtain correct recurrent states for invertedai::drive.
