Inverted-AI provides cutting-edge solutions for closing the SIM2Real gap for autonomous vehicle (AV) industry.
Industry leading AV simulators such as [Carla](https://carla.org/) and [NVIDIA DRIVE Sim](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/simulation/) have closed the SIM2Real gap and allow for obtaining real-world results from simulation by:

- Accurate Physics Simulation
- Photo-Realistic Scenes
- Accurate Sensor Data

However, one crucial piece of the puzzle is missing: **Human-Like NPCs** (non player characters).
State-of-the-art probabilistic behavioral models of Inverted-AI quantitatively and qualitatively outperform exiting logic-based and data-driven NPCs.

Inverted-AI also provides another product:

- Simulation as a service(SimaaS): AV simulation + Inverted-AI NPCs
  - Currently [Carla](https://carla.org/) ([Huawei SMARTS](https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS) and [NVIDIA DRIVE Sim](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/simulation/) in production.)
